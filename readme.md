# Tarot: The Qabalistic Mandala

> The traditional version of the *Wheel Of Fortune* card displays four letters, **T A R O** placed upon the rim of a great wheel. As the wheel turns we read the letters in a variety of orders and permutations including: OTAR (to purify oneself), ROTA (the wheel), AROT (vigilance), TORA (the law), ORAT (awe), TROA (gate), AT OR (thou art), RATOT (vibration)."
